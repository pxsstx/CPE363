                    <h3>Coffee bean</h3>
                    <p>A coffee bean is a seed from the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. This fruit is often
                        referred to as a coffee cherry, but unlike the cherry, which usually contains a single pit, it
                        is a berry most commonly found having two seeds with their flat sides together. Even though the
                        seeds are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to
                        true beans. A fraction of coffee cherries contain a single seed, called a "peaberry". Peaberries
                        make up only around 10% to 15% of all coffee beans. It is a fairly common belief that they have
                        more flavor than normal coffee beans. Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans
                        consist mostly of endosperm.</p>
