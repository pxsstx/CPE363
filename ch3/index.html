                    <h3>Coffee bean</h3>
                    <p>A coffee bean is a seed from the Coffea plant and the source for coffee. This fruit is often
                        referred to as a coffee cherry, but unlike the cherry, which usually contains a single pit, it
                        is a berry most commonly found having two seeds with their flat sides together. Even though the
                        seeds are not technically beans, they are referred to as such because of their resemblance to
                        true beans. A fraction of coffee cherries contain a single seed, called a "peaberry". Peaberries
                        make up only around 10% to 15% of all coffee beans. It is a fairly common belief that they have
                        more flavor than normal coffee beans. Like Brazil nuts (a seed) and white rice, coffee beans
                        consist mostly of endosperm.</p>

                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p class="about-lead">Lamoon was born from a simple belief: every cup of coffee deserves to tell a
                        story of quality, passion, and craftsmanship.</p>
                    <p>We are a team of coffee enthusiasts who have spent years traveling to coffee-growing regions
                        across the world — from the highlands of Ethiopia and Colombia to the volcanic soils of
                        Indonesia and the lush mountains of Thailand. Our journey has taught us that the finest coffee
                        beans come from farmers who care deeply about their craft, sustainable practices, and the land
                        that nurtures each harvest.</p>
                    <p>At Lamoon, we are dedicated to sourcing only the highest quality Arabica, Robusta, Excelsa, and
                        Liberica beans. Each batch is carefully selected, roasted to perfection, and delivered to you
                        with the same care we would extend to our own morning brew. We believe that great coffee is not
                        just a beverage — it is an experience that connects people, cultures, and moments.</p>
                    <p>Whether you are a seasoned barista or someone who simply enjoys a good cup at home, we are here
                        to share our passion and help you discover the extraordinary flavors that coffee has to offer.
